# The Xtensis Project

## Core goals

* Extendable

One of Xtensis' core goals is to be as extendable as possible, in a
similar manner to GNU Emacs. Emacs is good for extensions, but is
limited by only *one* language - Emacs LISP. Xtensis works around this
by defining a JSON-RPC structure in the core system, which is
_essentially_ the basis of Xtensis. Xtensis is pretty much a JSON-RPC
system, with modular addons to the core.

* Minimal
