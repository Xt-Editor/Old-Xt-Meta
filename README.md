# The Xt Project

## History

Xt started life as `slacs`, and those who followed its progress
in those times will remember it in those infancy stages, and whilst I
(@shymega) was developing my ideas further and in new directions.

Then Xt changed the name to `Xtensis`. It was shortly after this name
change that I realised that the executables generated by the compiler
had the name - take the core program for example - `xtc`. That is what
triggered the name change to `Xt`.

# Core goals

* Minimal

The aim is to keep Xt as _minimal_ as possible.

One looks at GNU Emacs, and 'lo and behold: it has Tetris support - by
default! That sort of thing is merely a gimmick, and to a certain
extent, bloat.

Xt focuses on the principle of **customisation** - we want each user's
installation of Xt to be *unique* to them. Of course, for all intents
and purposes, that's not always going to be the

However, the fact that **customisation** _is_ available provides that
particularly facility, and allows for further tweaking and
personalisation.

* Extendable

One of Xt's core goals is to be as extendable as possible, in a
similar manner to GNU Emacs. Emacs is good for extensions, but is
limited by only *one* language - Emacs LISP.

Xt works around this defining a small, extendable JSON-RPC server
in the core, and accepting requests from many XTCAPI (Xt Core
API) libraries, such as ones written in Python, Lua or even GNU
Guile!

At its core, Xt is merely a JSON-RPC server which is easily
extended by RPC requests from modules connected to it.

* Modular

Xt should be as modular as possible, to keep the core size down,
and to allow *maximum flexibility*.
