# Installing Xt

Xt is nowhere near ready for installation from `Crates.io` at this
moment in time.

If you just want to install xt-core into your `$HOME/.cargo/bin`
directory, then you need only to follow the command below:

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/xt-editor/xt-core.git
```

However, Core is not performing any tasks right now. It is best that
you work on the development version which you can clone from Github:
`git clone https://github.com/xt-editor/xt-core" and work/run from
there.

Thanks for your interest!
